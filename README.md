# Braccio.ino
The purpose of this project was to create a protected environment for chemical mixing inside a ventilated box (to avoid breathing of toxic fumes). An amateur airsoft team (Chimera Airsoft Team, where I used to play) asked me to build this. 

There is a little Braccio.h lib modification.
